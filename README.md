# Jeopardy Game with GUI
This project was created during my final year of high school for the Aerospace Club, which I was a co-founder of. The purpose was to create a custom program that could would only require the user to import text files containing a series of questions and answers they wanted to use. This would solve the problem of replayability that many online Jeopardy games suffer from. Additionally, programming the game myself would allow for a greater degree of customization.

## How it Works
It consists of many classes with a GUI connected to a 2D arraylist that contains hashmaps for each entry. 
This was for the purpose of creating a grid like data structure that was connected to assortment of questions and answers that would be randomly picked every time the game was run.
